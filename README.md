# Sterling's Python Archive

This repository serves as an archive of projects I created before I started
using GitHub. The programs included come from either my computer or Google Drive,
with there creation potentially spanning from 2016 to 2022. There is plenty of
buggy and incomplete code to go around, along with a severe lack of comments to
aide in understanding the not-entirely-descriptive names. I don't plan on
updating any of the code, but I have made a few minor changes. Most of the code
is written by me, but there may be instances, such as when following tutorials,
where I copied code. That being said I may add comments over time upon request
or as I see fit.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Best regards,<br>
Sterling
